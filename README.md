# Fork of [dorny/test-reporter][original-repo]

Original repository has great new additions (like the `use-actions-summary` option) that have not been released yet.  
So I have been using direct commit version into my GitHub workflows for some time.  
But since December 2024, Dependabot has been crashing when trying to update this dependency.  
So this fork has been created to make a new release that solve this issue.

I hope that [dorny/test-reporter][original-repo] will soon release a new version that contains the newest additions and that I could delete this fork.
